# FunctionApproximation

This repo contains experimentation files for

1. Generation of Chebyshev, Legendre, Legendre-Sobolev polynomials.
1. Approximation of digital strokes with those polynomials.
1. Running classification with distance to convex hulls of nearest neighbours.

I put it here primarily for archiving. It lacks proper documentation. If you are intersted/have questions, just message me.
